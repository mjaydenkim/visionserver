[NOT WORKING: Live Demo](http://138.68.30.41:5000)

Hello! This is my STEM project for the 6th grade STEM Expo. Upload a picture of anything (don't forget to submit) and this server will process the pictures with the help of Google's Cloud Vision API. It will check for one of these 7 categories- (not)hotdog, candy, cat, chips, fries, pizza, or dogs. If Google's API returns less than 80 percent accuracy for all of these topics, it will switch to general labels for the image provided. Thanks for visiting my booth, and feel free to try out the website.
